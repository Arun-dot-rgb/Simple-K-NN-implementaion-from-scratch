# Simple-K-NN-implementaion-from-scratch


Pseudocode forimplementing K-NN algorithm:

Intialize value for 'k'

fit function : K-NN only stores training data into memory,Since KNN does not perform any explicit training process.

Distance: We will calculate Euclidean distance here.

Predict function: We will predict the class for our testing instance using the complete training data. 

Score function: To calculate the score (Accuracy) for our model based on the test data
